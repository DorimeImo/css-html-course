      Expand snippets matching the current prefix with tab in Atom.
      To add your own snippets, select the Atom > Snippets... menu option if you're
      using macOS, or the File > Snippets... menu option if you're using Windows,
      or the Edit > Snippets... menu option if you are using Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outermost keys are the selectors where these snippets should be
       active, prefixed with a period (.) (details below).
       The next level of keys are the snippet names.
       Under each snippet name is a prefix that should trigger the snippet
        and a body to insert when the snippet is triggered.
